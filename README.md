This is a read-only unofficial mirror of the [OpenGrm Thrax Grammar Development Tools](http://opengrm.org/thrax).

This is simply a mirror of recent Thrax releases, for convenience. The Thrax toolkit was not developed here, the project is not active here, it does not accept pull requests here, and there is no issue tracker or wiki here. For all of these things, the [Thrax project home](http://opengrm.org/thrax) is the best place to go.
